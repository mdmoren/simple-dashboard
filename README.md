## Simple Dashboard
link: https://simple-dashboard.herokuapp.com/

### Using:
- ReactJS
- TailwindCSS
- Hosted on Heroku

### functionality
- task list (local storage)
- weather (weatherAPI)
- date and time
- quote generator (API)

All four of these functions viewed on one page serve as a dashboard and each card can be dragged and rearranged. 

## issues

- original repository was using ViteJS build and could not deploy successfully with Heroku so I created a new repository using create-react-app and transferred the code
